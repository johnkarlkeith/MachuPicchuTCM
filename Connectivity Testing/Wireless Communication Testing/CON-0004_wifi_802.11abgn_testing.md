Scenario 1 

 | \# | Step | Expected Behavior | 
 |----|------|-------------------| 
 |  1 | Open the Webapp, Log-in, and navigate between modules.      | App works with normal latency expected of older WiFi speeds.  | 
 |  2 | Browse images or heavy data pages.                          | Slight delay in content loading is acceptable.   | 
 |  3 | Monitor disconnects or instability.                         | App should not crash or freeze during lag.   | 


**Post-conditions:**  

 - App remains usable under moderate performance constraints.
